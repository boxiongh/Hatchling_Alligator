# Hatchling_Alligator

## Naming Inspiration and Target:
Regarding the name of this repository: 'Hatchling and Alligator'. Hatchling is the name of an alligator when it in the baby stage. I hope to create a deep learning library that can grow up to strong and powerful in this field; hence, I called my model in the name of Alligator and the library in Hatchling. I hope in the future, this lib and model can be improved to one of the famous and useful platforms in the corresponding field.

## Motivation and What I did:
1. Studied Prof Andrew Ng's deep learning neural network courses from Coursera since the assignment are relatively independent, and the network structure requires some hand coding for parameters caching. Therefore, Alligator is designed to automatically generate and read the parameters from different setup of the NN structure. 
2. Alligator_v01 provided binary classifier deep learning model by first-order gradient descent optimisation algorithms, such as 1) **Gradient Descent**, 2) **GD with Momentum**, 3) **GD with RMSprop**, 4) **GD with Adam**. And all optimisations can also train with **Mini-batch** algorithm. A regularisation technique **L2 regulariser** also integrated with the model to improve the test/dev set performance. There are total **16** combinations to train your dataset.
3. At the end of the model provides the comparison result and training time to help user select the most suitable model for their data.

## Future Plan:
1. The details of how to model construct study notes will be uploaded in the future.
2. Future study case would be studied in the future.
3. My lecture notes from Prof Andrew Ng available for request.
4. Please don't hesitate to contact me or create an issue when you got a problem with the Alligator.
5. Also, please don't hesitate to contact me or create an issue when the Alligator's found problem due to my misunderstanding about the knowledge. I appreciate the guess who help me to improve the skill.

## Disclaimer:
This repository only available and sharing for the purpose of the study. Some of the parts of the codes are sorting from Prof. Andrew Ng's deep learning courses on Coursera; hence, please also follow the restriction rules from the courses.
